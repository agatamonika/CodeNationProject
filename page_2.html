        <h4>Welcoming me into the world</h4>
        </div>
        <div class=ppara1>
            <p>After I was born i stayed with my mum for several weeks, i had some visits with my adoptive parents where they came to see me! I was the naughtiest out of all my brothers and sisters always teasing them and biting my mum <b>anytime</b> she tried to do <b>anything</b>, I finally arrived in my new home on the 16th of January and have been unconditionally loved since. My first few adventures consisted of learning how to climb the stairs, attacking anything that moves especially the hoover and mop and how not to bite mums furniture. There was also a lot of napping involved after a good playtime... </p>

        <h4>My teenage years</h4>
        </div>
        <div class=ppara2>
            <p>My teenage years were the most fun, I was a little bigger and faster so I could experience more! Meeting so many new doggys and starting out in daycare was <b>SO MUCH FUN</b>. Mum and dad lost some shoes and lot of towels, I started to discover myself and what I like and them traits have stuck with me up until now. Mum says the most annoying one is stealing clean socks off the maiden and leaving them around the house. For my first birthday mum made me doggy cakes and I got lots of presents to open. I had legs too big for my body and spent a lot of time using them to run off on walks, took me a good while to learn what recall is... </p>

        <h4>Me and my daddy</h4>
        </div>
        <div class=ppara3>
            <p>My mummy's brother has my daddy (Bugzy) so i got to and still get to spend a lot of time with him. He was my first real friend and is the only doggy I have ever met that I will listen to when they put me in my place, we always kiss when were together and I have never done that with any other dog before. When we go on walkies together people think we're twins! I think I'm a lot more handsome though. Personality wise I'm like neither of my real parents, they were both a lot more calm, I'm like a tornado, always <b>full</b> of energy and ready to go. I have <b>NO</b> fear, not scared of fireworks or water. I don't learn from my mistakes and even want to play with doggys that growl at me, I'm completely and utterly nuts!!</p>
