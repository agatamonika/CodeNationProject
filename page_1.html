        <div class="who_i_am">
        <ul>
            <li>I am a very happy and bouncy Boxer doggy.</li>
            <li>I was born on the 22nd of November 2018 in the early hours of the morning.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to come from a <b>huge</b> litter, there were 9 of us all together!</li>
            <li>I'm raw fed but i absolutely <b>love</b> boiled chicken, so my mum and dad treat me sometimes and i always get it when im unwell.</li>
            <li>My birth mums name is Luna and my real dad is called Bugzy, my adoptive parents are called Agata and Adam, they love me very much and treat me like a king.</li>
            <li>I am the spitting image of my dad, we have very similar markings and i think thats why my parents picked me, im like a mini me but twice as naughty with a <b>much</b> longer tongue.</li>

        <h3><u>What I like</u></h3>
    </div>
        <div class="what_i_like">
            <ul>
                <li>I <b>LOVE</b> any kind of meat really, i think lamb and chicken would be my favourite if i had to choose but i do love my fish aswell, makes me all silky smooth and then more of the humans stroke me.</li>
                <li>For treats when im a good boy or just as a snack im more picky, theres only certain ones i like... But you know what I'll <b>always</b> happily snack on... <bigger><b>CHEESE</b></bigger>, Id do anything for a slice of mature cheddar, don't try and fool me though... It has to be 'Cathedral City'. I can smell the difference!</li>
                <li>I'm the happiest when I'm outside, anywhere outside, just out exploring the open world. There are so many smells!! I love running in Heaton park and meeting new friends, going on long hikes and adventures in different forests. When my human slave parents take me to new places I do the best <b>zooooooomies</b> and always jump into any type of water there is, they laugh and say I was a fish in my past life because I'm always trying to get wet and I'm a brilliant swimmer.  </li>
                <li>My favourite toys are the ones that I can grab and rag or throw around, love any size of balls the bigger ones like dads football always go all floppy when I play with them though and mum looks all angry like it was my fault... Obviously it never is my fault... I love the ones i can bring to my humans to pull on so i can challenge them and the ones that make a <b>lot</b> of noise. Plus balloons; balloons are the best.</li>

    </div>
        <div class="yet_to_do">
            <ul>
                <li>I've been banned from doggy-day-care recently for getting a bit too close and personal with the other doggos so im due to get a girlfriend soon, mum says ill be able to go back to see my friends in day-care if i calm down and stop annoying and jumping on all of the dogs. I'm really excited to meet a new lady friend! Mum made me a whole dating profile.</li>
                <li>I'm yet to visit another country, I still don't have a passport but will be making one for the summer to come so i can go abroad with adoptive humans and join them on the beach, <b>NO WAY</b> are they leaving me behind with someone that doesn't know me inside out, I'm well to spoilt to not have 24/7 hour care... So I'm coming with!</li>
                <li>Unfortunately I don't have a big outdoor outside my home at the moment but ive been promised that I will get one soon and when I do I'm getting a friend to share my home with! I get very upset when I'm left alone so mum says when I have a friend we can be naughty together and maybe I'll consider not howling the house down when i get left for 5 minutes... Feels like forever, not my fault.</li>
